## Project description

CHARM (ANR-21-CE94-0003, CCF-2122230) is a 3-year [ANR-NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21020/nsf21020.jsp) project that started in October 2021, on cryptographically relevant hard problems for module lattices. This is a joint project between teams located at four sites, headed by:
 - Shi Bai (FAU)
 - Damien Stehlé (ENS Lyon)
 - Noah Stephens-Davidowitz (Cornell)
 - Benjamin Wesolowski (U. Bordeaux)
